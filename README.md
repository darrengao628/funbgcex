# FunBGCeX (Fungal Biosynthetic Gene Cluster eXtractor)

## Overview
FunBGCeX is a genome mining tool for fungal natural product discovery, which detect biosynthetic proteins based on our manually curated database of fungal natural product biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), [FunBGCs](http://staffweb1.cityu.edu.hk/ymatsuda/funbgcs/funbgcs.html). FunBGCeX can extract not only all possible BGCs from given fungal genomes but also those encoding a protein of user's interest. The extracted BGCs are provided in the GenBank format and can also be visualized using a web browser.
